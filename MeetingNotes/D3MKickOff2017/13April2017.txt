Introductions.
Pedro summary of what happened in the PI meeting.
All components should be pip installable. The components will be there in the repo.
Like a beauty contest. Make sure people use what you produce.

Prem: in terms of budget, they will have to downselect more than 1/3rd of the budget -> more than one third of the teams.

There are many expectations on us in terms what we will deliver.
Start doing something from the beginning.

Handling raw files (images and sound)

One evaluation with 100 files and figure everuything for itself.
Another evaluation with a human in the loop.

TA2 components should define an API to plug in with TA3 components.

Pedro introduced how they had been talking to other people to collaborate.

TA2 components are evaluated in terms of discoverability too. That is, list the pipelines we considered in our process.

During the evaluation -> 100 datasets. We cannot assume anything about the domain.
Any dataset that we used HAS to be reported.

First five weeks we assume that we have clean data.

You run several feature augmentations in paralel, then select the ones that succeed and proceed with the rest.

Keep it simple.

2 meetings: A TA2 meeting (weekly)
Subs meeting (high level meeting)
Standup meeting every day.

Add hyperparameter optimization by week 9.
